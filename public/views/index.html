              <p>So long, farewell. After making great strides over the past few years, we have made the difficult
                decision
                to
                close our doors.</p>
              <p>We are incredibly proud of what we built. We’ll miss using it ourselves.</p>
              <p>Although we designed a business that customers absolutely love, it proved hard to scale into the
                profitability
                it needed to be sustainable.</p>
              <p>While succeeding in one goal, we couldn’t make the other.</p>

              <h2>Background</h2>
              <p>Love Property, initially established in 2017 under the name "Realli," began as a platform dedicated to
                advertising and selling new home developments. Though we enjoyed initial success, the unforeseen impact
                of
                COVID
                and a decline in new home launches prompted a shift in our focus in 2020.</p>
              <p>Embracing change, we rebranded to Love Property, adopting a fresh mission to curate and showcase the
                finest
                properties for both casual browsers and serious buyers. Throughout our journey, from Realli to Love
                Property,
                leveraging the power of social media and high-quality media content was our core focus."</p>
